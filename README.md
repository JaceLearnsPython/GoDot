## Brot Blitz
This project is a card game based on Dutch Blitz, a game created by a Dutch immigrant in the 20th century. I have played the game with friends and family since I was a child and I have
always wanted to play this game online as I can't play it with others as much as I want to. It is my hope I can utilize GoDot
to create an online version of this game. 

## Rules

- All Players have a "Blitz" pile with 10 cards stacked and only the top card is accessible and visible.
- All players have 3 cards in front of them that they can play and replace the empty spot with a card from the blitz pile.
- All Players play simultaneously.
- When a player has 0 cards in their Blitz pile, the game ends, and the score is calculated.
- Played cards are 1 point and each card left in a player's Blitz pile is -1 point.
- Cards are played in ascending order on matching suits (Ace->10).

## Modes

**SingePlayer** will have four modes to choose from.
- Easy
- Normal
- Hard
- Good Luck

The mode's difficulty is tied to the restrictions placed on the AI players. The more difficult the mode, the faster the AI can play!

**Multiplayer**
TBD
